    <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
    <p>
        Mind<br>Mind<br>
        
        <br>Sittin' all alone<br>Mouth full of gum<br>
        In the driveway<br>My friends aren't far<br>
        In the back of my car<br>Lay their bodies<br>
        
        <br>Where's my mind?<br>Where's my mind?<br>

        <br>They'll be here pretty soon<br>
        Lookin' through my room for the money<br>
        I'm bitin' my nails<br>I'm too young to go to jail<br>
        It's kinda funny<br>
        
        <br>Where's my mind?<br>Where's my mind?<br>Where's my mind?<br>Where's my mind?<br>
        
        <br>Maybe it's in the gutter<br>Where I left my lover<br>What an expensive fake<br>
        My V is for Vendetta<br>Thought that I'd feel better<br>But now I got a bellyache<br>

        <br>Everything I do<br>The way I wear my noose<br>Like a necklace<br>I wanna make 'em scared<br>
        Like I could be anywhere<br>Like I'm reckless<br>

        <br>I lost my mind<br>I don't mind<br>Where's my mind?<br>Where's my mind?<br>

        <br>Maybe it's in the gutter<br>Where I left my lover<br>What an expensive fake<br>
        My V is for Vendetta<br>Thought that I'd feel better<br>But now I got a bellyache<br>
        (Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)<br>(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)<br>

        <br>Maybe it's in the gutter<br>Where I left my lover<br>What an expensive fake<br>
        My V is for Vendetta<br>Thought that I'd feel better<br>But now I got a bellyache<br>
